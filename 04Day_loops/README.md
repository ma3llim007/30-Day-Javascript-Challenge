# Achievement
- Understand and use for loops to iterate over a sequence of numbers.
- Utilize while loops for iteration based on a condititon.
- Apply do...while loops to ensure the loop body is exectured at least once.
- implement nested loops to solve more complex problems.
- use loop control statements `break` and `continue` to control the flow of loops
